shell.me
========

shell.me - your universal shell framework

What does shell.me try to solve?
================================

We often find us wrapping code in a minimalistic console app just to run it
with the OS task scheduler at a specific interval. That's a dump, repetitive and tiresome
task to do. It's getting even worse once you start to parse parameters again and again.

shell.me is our attempt to fix that.

What does shell.me offer?
=========================

- it provides a simple way to run any custom implemented command 
  (just create a dll project, implement a very simple interface and drop the dll
  into the shell.me directory)
